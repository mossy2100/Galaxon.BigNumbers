# Galaxon.BigRational

Value type to encapsulate rational numbers (fractions). Analogous to Java's BigRational.

It uses BigIntegers under the hood to permit large scale numerators and denominators.

This is a work in progress :) But it's coming along well, it should be available for
general use in 2024.

Depends on [Galaxon.Core](https://github.com/mossy2100/Galaxon.Core)

Depended on by [Galaxon.BigDecimal](https://github.com/mossy2100/Galaxon.BigDecimal)
